# User Story
As a hungry adult,
When I search for restaurants in my area,
Then I am presented with memes telling me their average ratings.
When I search for my location by zip code,
I am presented with a list of restaurants.
When I see the restaurant,
A silly meme/gif tells me the average rating for that restaurant.
When restaurants have the same ratings,
A variety of memes/gifs are used to depict that rating.
If we are idle too long, a meme pops up telling us we are taking too long.
